# replication_metrics

This repository contains efforts to clarify subjective notions about whether a set of studies replicate a finding. These notions are implied by analyses of recent empirical evaluations of replication, and the files contained here support work on the translation of these into scientifically meaningful statements, as well as the properties of the analyses performed. 

The repository is organized by metric type, and each of those subdirectories contain written results and relevant code. In addition, the 'src' directory contains general scripts related to multiple metrics.
